# GeoStick - Android app
<p align="justify">Reminders are must for every human, using sticky notes is most common way of reminding things to do. Smart phones made these reminders easy to set, these smart phones also gives you a convenience to set reminder for a particular time and at particular location. But the applications that are in use for setting reminders organize all these reminders in a list which is not a user friendly way. Populating the location based reminders you make at a particular location on a map is one of the efficient way to organize reminders, Geo stick a Location based reminder system fallows the same. Geo stick has another feature i.e. a new way of sending message, using Geo stick we donâ€™t send a send message we just drop it. If a reminder or a message is set using Geo stick, whenever a person enters into that geo boundary set earlier he gets the notification. Geo stick classifies the location based reminders into three categories and they are I geo stick, We geo stick and You geo stick. A person can identify the geo stick based on the color of the marker which is an easy interpretation. User can set the radius of the geo stick, this allows him to customize the geo boundary for each and every geo stick.</p>
